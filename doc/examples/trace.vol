### 'Trace' translator is a very handy debug tool for GlusterFS, as it can be loaded between any of the two volumes without changing the behaviour of the filesystem. 
# On client side it can be the top most volume in spec (like now) to understand what calls are made on FUSE filesystem, when a mounted filesystem is accessed.

volume trace
  type debug/trace
  subvolumes client
end-volume

# 'NOTE:' By loading 'debug/trace' translator, filesystem will be very slow as it logs each and every calls to the log file.
